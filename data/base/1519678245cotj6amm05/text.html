(The &quot;pretty good&quot; bit is meant to be a bit of an ironic understatement.) In addition to encrypting and decrypting email, PGP is used to sign messages so that the receiver can verify both the identity of the sender and the integrity of the content. PGP uses a private key that must be kept secret and a public key that sender and receiver must share. The technology is also known as GPG (Gnu Privacy Guard or GnuPG), which is a fully compatible GPL-licensed alternative.  </span></p></body></html>
